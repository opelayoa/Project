    WARNING:
    The code supporting this sample has been provided as a single Android app for illustrative
    purposes. In practice you should not distribute your server-side API keys in an Android app as
    your key cannot be secured against unauthorised access from a third party. Instead, to secure
    your keys you should deploy the API-facing code as a server-side proxy and have your Android app
    send requests via the proxy, ensuring requests are authorized.
